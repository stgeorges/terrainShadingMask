# terrainShadingMask
terrainShadingMask is a free collection of terrain masks for various locations.
They are given in geometrical (.obj files) and textual (.hor files) forms.



# Description
A terrain shading mask is a diagram which maps the silhouette of the surrounding terrain (hills, valleys, mountains, tree tops...) around the [chosen location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/42%C2%B041'25.6%22N+22%C2%B010'17.1%22E/@42.6904405,22.1708855,135m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d42.690457!4d22.171431):

</p>

Building simulation softwares (IES VE, Trnsys 3D, Design Builder...) can use the .obj geometry files, while solar-photovoltaic-thermal software (PV*SOL, PVsyst...) can use .hor files.



# Installation
No installation is required.

One just needs to look into the ```objFiles``` folder if one is looking for a geometric representation of the mask, or into the ```horFiles``` folder for textual representation of the mask.
Both folders contain ```0_terrain_shading_masks_download_links.tsv``` files which can be used to more easily search the masks according to a certain continent and country, and get their direct download links.



# Additional info


All .obj and .hor files are created with the use of Grasshopper 'Terrain shading mask' and 'Horizon Angles' components which are part of the [Ladybug](https://github.com/stgeorges/ladybug) project. Free and open source environmental plugin. Ladybug is licensed under the GPL-3.0+ license: http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+.


'Terrain shading mask' component uses SRTM GL3 Global 90m raster data accessed via [OpenTopography](http://www.opentopography.org/).


'Terrain shading mask' component uses SRTM 3 arc second raster data from:
[Viewfinderpanoramas](http://viewfinderpanoramas.org).


It also uses [C# GDAL libraries](http://gisinternals.com/) to project the SRTM raster data.
